!!!Description
The Exomiser is a program that finds potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data.

Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) it will annotate, filter and prioritize likely causative variants. The program does this based on user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population and also how closely the given phenotype matches the known phenotype of diseased genes from human and model organism data.

The functional annotation of variants is handled by Jannovar and uses UCSC KnownGene transcript definitions and hg19 genomic coordinates.

Variants are prioritized according to user-defined criteria on variant frequency, pathogenicity, quality, inheritance pattern, and model organism phenotype data. Predicted pathogenicity data is extracted from the dbNSFP resource. Variant frequency data is taken from the 1000 Genomes, ESP and ExAC datasets. Subsets of these frequency and pathogenicity data can be defined to further tune the analysis. Cross-species phenotype comparisons come from PhenoDigm tool powered by the OWLTools OWLSim algorithm.
